Course Description
------------------

In this course we will learn about and build Experimental Robots for
Theatrical Performance. Consisting of both theory and practice studnets will
learn about electronics, programming, robotics, and mechanical construction
techniques, as well as the use of machines in theatrical performances, both
historical and contemporary. We define robots very broadly, and consider a
broad range of machines both autonomous and remote-controlled. 

Consisting of lecture, discussion, and hands-on construction, students will go
through some electro-mechanical construction exercises before moving on to the
major project of the course: building a robot. The course will culminate with
a performance.

Prerequisites: TODO

Learning Outcomes
-----------------
* Develop a basic understanding of electronics, programming, and mechatronics
* Develop a basic understanding of the principles of simple robotics
* Learn about the history and contemporary state of robots and other machines
	in theatrical performance
* Learn how to define and build a Minimum Viable Project, and how to adapt
	dependencies (e.g. scripts) to changing abilities

Teaching Methodology
--------------------
This is a production-based course that involves programming, working with
electronics, and working with mechanisms work both inside and outside of the
classroom.  reviewed. Examples will presented and discussed throughout, and
students will be required to write code, build circuits, build mechanisms, ask
questions, and engage in both creative and technical discussion. The course
embraces a process-oriented philosophy believing that programming,
electronics, and mechatronics development are best learned by doing. 

Course Mission: L.E.G.S.
------------------------
* Learn - skills, tools, processes, techniques, resources
* Explore - challenges, risks, failures, adventures, dreams 
* Grow - advance, empower, progress, reflect, repeat
* Share - describe, document, communicate, contribute, participate

Grading
-------
**10%** Attendance  
**10%** Participation  
**25%** Homework Assignments + Online Journal  
**25%** Projects #1 & #2      
**30%** Final Project    

Homework Assignments
---------------
There will be homework assignments in each class. Homework may include
reading, watching videos, doing exercises, constructing circuits and
mechanisms, and completing projects. Students may collaborate with classmates
and work together on any assignment(s), but everyone must share/submit their
own individual work.  

Some class time will be spent going over assignments. Expect to be asked to
show your work every class. Some classes everyone may demonstrate their work,
other classes only a few students will share, but always be prepared to do so.
All of your work must be completed on time prior to class.

Online Journal
---------------
Students must document all their work in a Github repository. This must
include:

* a well organized repository with helpful file and folder names
* description of each assignment or project
* discuss what you chose to do and why
* document any resources/research/inspiration
* all code, well structured and commented
* schematics
* drawings of mechanisms
* highlight both successes and failures

The purpose of the journal is threefold. First, it is a valuable way for you to communicate that you are keeping up with the work in the class and that you are grasping the material. I read the journals to see how you are doing. 

Second, the journal is a way to document your work for your own use. You must
update the journal each week with the work you have done for class. You should
use the journal as an opportunity to write clearly write your thoughts,
questions, and analysis based on the class assignments. The writing is
expected to be well reasoned and grammatically correct. You should link to any
relevant sources, and provide context, such as images, video or audio, when
appropriate. 

Third, we all make extensive use of online resources generously created by
others. By sharing our own work, we pay forward, making what we learned
available in the hopes that others might benefit.

Attendance & Participation
--------------------------

* Attendance is mandatory. Every class builds off the previous one so it is vital to be present for every lesson. Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will negatively impact your final grade for the class. If you are going to be late or absent, please email me **in advance**. If you have an emergency, please let me know as soon as you can.
* More than two unexcused absences (more than 20 minutes late to class) will result in a lower final grade (e.g. B+ to B). More than five unexcused absences will result in an F.
* Showing up on time, engaging in the class discussion, and offering advice and input during class is a major part of your grade. Participating in class is helpful for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your progress, but most importantly, it provides you and your classmates the opportunity to share failures, successes, and insights on the work you are doing.
* Please turn in all assignments on time. For each day an assignment is late, it will result in a lower final grade (e.g. B+ to B).
* You are expected to show work in class. This includes your Github
	 repository, your attempts, and your results whether working or not.
	 You will share what worked and what didn't.
	 Basically, don’t be afraid to volunteer to show what you did do or
	 failed to do. Explaining your work to other people is a great way to better
	 understand the material and answer questions for yourself. Plus, showing
	 work that did not function as expected is not a sign of failure, it is an
	 opportunity to learn. 

* Ask questions. If you do not ask questions, I can only assume you understand the material completely.

Laptops
-------
Laptop use will be expected in class, but should be focused on class-specific material, applications, and research. Whenever classmates are presenting please keep your laptop closed. The quality of the class depends in large part on your attention and active participation, so please respect your fellow classmates and close your lid.

Mobile Phones
-------------
 Please put them on vibrate or turn them off before you come to class. If you have an emergency that requires you to answer your phone during class, please let me know me ahead of time or quietly step out of class to take the call.

Communicate
-----------
If you have any questions, would like extra help, or need further instruction, please reach out to me. You can communicate with me via e-mail, sign up for ofice hours, speak with me before class, after class or during break, but please let me know if you have any concerns pertaining to the course.
