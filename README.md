### Course Description

As new technologies are developed, artists are among the first to apply these
technologies in ways that were unanticipated by the designers. Sometimes
resulting in surprisingly practical new applications of the technology,
artists also explore its meaning and significance to the human condition.

What will be the effects of living among robots? What will it feel like to us
humans? What will the robots look like? If the history of predictions has
taught us anything, it's that predictions are often inaccurate. We don't
expect that our future with robots will look very much like most science
fiction depictions.

Students will learn about and build Experimental Robots for Theatrical
Performance. Material covered includes the history, critique, and current
state of robots (and related machines) in the context of art.  Questions we
will attempt to address include: "Beyond the element of novelty, can robotic
performances be compelling?", "Why make robotic performances?", "What can
robotic performers do that human performers can't, and is that important for a
performance?", "Using limited technology and tools, how can we create robots
to convey meaning and emotion?" and "How can technology be used meaningfully,
rather than just to rescue a weak artistic concept?". On a more technical
level, we will learn about interactivity and autonomy, and explore the tension
between these and remote controlled devices.

Consisting of theory and practice students will learn about electronics,
programming, robotics, and mechanical construction techniques, as well as the
use of machines in theatrical performances, both historical and contemporary.
We define robots very broadly, and consider a broad range of machines both
autonomous and remote-controlled.

Starting with electronic, programming, and mechanical projects, each student
will finally design and construct their own performative robot.  The course
will culminate with a performance using these robots.

### Course Objectives: (TODO)
When the course is finished, students will:
- Identify 
- Have gained an understanding of how machines can be interactive and 
	autonomous
- Be able to design and develop
- Identify 
- Develop a basic understanding of electronics, programming, and mechatronics
- Develop a basic understanding of the principles of simple robotics
- Learn about the history and contemporary state of robots and other machines
	in theatrical performance
- Learn how to define and build a Minimum Viable Project, and how to adapt
	dependencies (e.g. scripts) to changing abilities

### Course Assignments
This course consists of theoretical readings and discussions,
technical training in electronics, programming, and mechatronics,
designing, fabricating, and programming a performing robot,
and putting on a final performance.

#### Readings
Readings will include selections from books, essays, articles, and research
papers both in print and in online form. The readings will introduce students
to the history, current state, and critique of autonomous interactive
robotic art, as well as covering technical topics.

#### Reading Response 
Each student is expected to post a response to one of the readings of their
choosing the day before the lecture. The response should be between 300 and
500 words and should be posted on a public website (e.g. Tumblr, Blogger, 
Wordpress, Github, the class website, or your own website). 


#### Projects
Class projects will consist of 2 short projects leading up to a major third
project

#### Required Textbooks
There are no required textbooks.

#### Recommended Textbooks
There are no recommended textbooks.

#### Supplemental Textbooks
See section titled "Books" [here](references.md)

### Attendance and Participation

#### Attendance and late arrivals
Attendance and arrival on time to all class sessions is required and
expected. Two unexcused absences lower your final grade by a letter.  Each
subsequent unexcused absence will lower another letter grade. Two late
arrivals will count as one absence. Arriving more than 20 minutes late will
also count as an absence.

If you will be missing a class due to illness or unavoidable personal
circumstances, you must notify your professor in advance via email for the
absence to be eligible to be excused.

#### Participation
Showing up on time, engaging in the class discussion, and offering advice and
input during class is a major part of your grade. Participating in class is
helpful for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your
progress, but most importantly, it provides you and your classmates the
opportunity to share successes, failures, and insights into the work you are
doing.

Turn in all assignments on time. For each day an assignment is late, it will
result in a lower final grade (e.g. B+ to B).

You are expected to show work in class. This includes your Github repository,
your attempts, and your results whether working or not. You will share what
worked and what didn't.  Basically, don’t be afraid to volunteer to show what
you did do or failed to do. Explaining your work to other people is a great
way to better understand the material and answer questions for yourself. Plus,
showing work that did not function as expected is not a sign of failure, it is
an opportunity to learn. 

Ask questions. If you do not ask questions, I can only assume that you are not
prepared for the lesson.

#### Laptops
Laptop use will be expected in class, but should be focused on class-specific
material, applications, and research. Whenever classmates are presenting
please keep your laptop closed. The quality of the class depends in large part
on your engagement and active participation, so please respect your fellow
classmates and close your lid.

#### Mobile Phones
 Please put them on vibrate or turn them off before you come to class. If you
have an emergency that requires you to answer your phone during class, please
let me know me ahead of time or quietly step out of class to take the call.

#### Communicate
If you have any questions, would like extra help, or need further instruction,
please reach out to me. You can communicate with me via e-mail, sign up for
ofice hours, speak with me before class, after class or during break, but
please let me know if you have any concerns pertaining to the course. I am
very willing to help, but you have to take the first step of reaching out to
me.

### Academic Integrity
As set forth in NYU Abu Dhabi's Academic Integrity Policy, the relationship
between students and 
faculty at NYU Abu Dhabi is defined by a shared commitment to academic
excellence and is 
grounded in an expectation of fairness, honesty, and respect, which are
essential to maintaining the 
integrity of the community. Every student who enrolls and everyone who accepts
an appointment as 
a member of the faculty or staff at NYU Abu Dhabi agrees to abide by the
expectation of academic 
honesty.

Teaching Methodology
--------------------
This is a production-based course that involves programming, working with
electronics, and working with mechanisms work both inside and outside of the
classroom.  reviewed. Examples will presented and discussed throughout, and
students will be required to write code, build circuits, build mechanisms, ask
questions, and engage in both creative and technical discussion. The course
embraces a process-oriented philosophy believing that programming,
electronics, and mechatronics development are best learned by doing. 

Course Mission: L.E.G.S.
------------------------
* Learn - skills, tools, processes, techniques, resources
* Explore - challenges, risks, failures, adventures, dreams 
* Grow - advance, empower, progress, reflect, repeat
* Share - describe, document, communicate, contribute, participate

Homework Assignments
---------------
There will be homework assignments in each class. Homework may include
reading, watching videos, doing exercises, constructing circuits and
mechanisms, and completing projects. Students may collaborate with classmates
and work together on any assignment(s), but everyone must share/submit their
own individual work.  

Some class time will be spent going over assignments. Expect to be asked to
show your work every class. Some classes everyone may demonstrate their work,
other classes only a few students will share, but always be prepared to do so.
All of your work must be completed on time prior to class.

Online Journal
---------------
Students must document all their work in a Github repository. This must
include:

* a well organized repository with helpful file and folder names
* description of each assignment or project
* discuss what you chose to do and why
* document any resources/research/inspiration
* all code, well structured and commented
* schematics
* drawings of mechanisms
* highlight both successes and failures

The purpose of the journal is threefold. First, it is a valuable way for you to communicate that you are keeping up with the work in the class and that you are grasping the material. I read the journals to see how you are doing. 

Second, the journal is a way to document your work for your own use. You must
update the journal each week with the work you have done for class. You should
use the journal as an opportunity to write clearly write your thoughts,
questions, and analysis based on the class assignments. The writing is
expected to be well reasoned and grammatically correct. You should link to any
relevant sources, and provide context, such as images, video or audio, when
appropriate. 

Third, we all make extensive use of online resources generously created by
others. By sharing our own work, we pay forward, making what we learned
available in the hopes that others might benefit.
