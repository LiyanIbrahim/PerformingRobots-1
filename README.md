### Course Description

Intelligent robots living amongst ordinary people used to be a storyline
relegated to the world of science-fiction. 
However, from military organizations and manufacturing companies to
mobile devices and maid services, the 21st century has
witnessed a rapid adoption of automated machinery in both the private and
public sector.  

Assuming robotic technology continues to proliferate, what will it mean for us
to live amongst robots? What will these robots look like and how will they
behave? How can we meaningfully effect their development and impact? If the
history of predicting the future has taught us anything, it's that predictions
are often inaccurate. We shouldn't expect that our future with robots will
look or act very much like most science-fiction depictions. However, as new
technologies are developed, it tends to be artists who are the first to apply
these technologies in surprising, unanticipated, and often enlightening
fashions.

Thus, in this course, students will explore the significance of robots through
the context of art by learning about and building experimental robots for
theatrical performance. We will define robots broadly and consider a wide
range of machines, both autonomous and remote-controlled, for the purpose of
creative expression and performance. Fundamental questions we will attempt to
address include:

- Why make robotic performances?
- Beyond the element of novelty, can robotic performances be compelling?
- How can we create robots that convey meaning and emotion?
- What can robotic performers do that human performers can't? And is that
	important for a performance?

Course material will incorporate both theoretical and practical components.
Students will be exposed to critical analysis regarding the historical and
contemporary use of machines in the context of art and theatrical
performance. In parallel, students will also learn about electronics,
programming, robotics and mechanical construction techniques. Over the
course of the semester, students will iterate through multiple robotic
projects culminating with their own performative robot. The course will
finish with a public performance by the robots.


### Learning Outcomes: 
When the course is finished, students will:
* Develop a conceptual model for the role and significance of robots in
daily life 
* Develop a critical understanding of the historical and contemporary
use of robots in the performing arts
* Establish a basic understanding of electronics, programming,
mechatronics, and simple robotics
* Gain the ability to identify, compare, and contrast  examples
of robotic interactivity, autonomy, and remote control
* Gain the ability to conceptualize, design, construct,
program, and debug a performing robot
* Become empowered to produce a Minimum Viable Project
(MVP) and adapt product dependencies (e.g. scripts) to
changing abilities

### Course Assignments
This course consists of theoretical readings and discussions, technical
training in electronics, programming, and mechatronics, designing,
fabricating, and programming a performing robot, and putting on a final
performance.

#### Reading Responses 
Each student is expected to post a short response to one of the readings of
their choosing the day before the lecture. The response should be about 300
words and should be posted on a public website (e.g. Tumblr, Blogger,
Wordpress, Github, the class website, or your own website). 


#### Homework exercises
Occasional homework exercises will be used to deepen understanding and
familiarity with technical material such as electronics and programming. All
material will be provided in the required course kit.

#### Projects
Class projects will consist of 3 minor projects leading up to a major final
project

### Grading
**10%** Attendance  
**10%** Participation  
**20%** Homework Assignments + Online Journal  
**30%** Projects 1, 2, and 3  
**30%** Final Project    

#### Attendance
Attendance and arrival on time to all class sessions is required and
expected. Two unexcused absences lower your final grade by a letter.  Each
subsequent unexcused absence will lower another letter grade. Two late
arrivals will count as one absence. Arriving more than 20 minutes late will
also count as an absence.

If you will be missing a class due to illness or unavoidable personal
circumstances, you must notify your professor in advance via email for the
absence to be eligible to be excused.

**Grade for Attendance**

A - One excused absence  
B - Two excused absences  
C - Three excused absences  
D - One unexcused absence  

#### Participation
Showing up on time, engaging in the class discussion, asking questions and
offering answers and in general participating in lessons and discussions
during class is an important part of your grade. Participation in class is
important to deepen your understanding and is helpful for me to get to know
you as an individual and keep track of your progress, and, it provides you and
your classmates the opportunity to share successes, failures, and insights
into the work you are doing.

Turn in all assignments on time. For each day an assignment is late, it will
result in a lower final grade (e.g. B+ to B).

You are expected to show work in class. This includes your Github repository,
your attempts, and your results whether working or not. You will share what
worked and what didn't.  Basically, don’t be afraid to volunteer to show what
you did do or failed to do. Explaining your work to other people is a great
way to better understand the material and answer questions for yourself.
Showing work that did not function as expected is not a sign of failure, it is
an opportunity to learn. 

Ask questions. If you do not ask questions, I can only assume that you are not
prepared for the lesson.

**Grades for Participation**

A - Almost always prepared for class including: 
seated and settled, with notebook and assignment ready, at the
beginning of each lesson, ready to engage in class discussion. Has questions
or observations prepared, and ready to answer questions from instructor. 
If encountered difficulty
with assignment, can clearly describe the unexpected behavior and what paths
were taken to try to resolve them. Asks questions in class.
Almost always engages in discussion with instructor and other students. 
Frequently offers assistance to other students.  
B - Occasionally prepared in most of the ways indicated above.  
C - Infrequently prepared in most of the ways indicated above.  
D - Rarely or never prepared in most of the ways indicated above.  

### Readings
Readings will include selections from books, essays, articles, and research
papers both in print and in online form. 

All required readings will be available electronically.

Supplemental texts will be available electronically or in the library.

#### Required Textbooks
Kit for Performing Robots (available in the bookstore)

#### Supplemental Textbooks
[Here](references.md#books)

#### Laptops
Bring your laptop to every class, but save it for class-specific work. During
presentations, lectures, and discussions please keep your laptop closed
(unless necessary for the discussion). The quality of the class depends in
large part on your engagement and active participation, so please respect your
fellow classmates and close your lid.

#### Mobile Phones
 Please put them on vibrate or turn them off before you come to class. If you
have an emergency that requires you to answer your phone during class, please
let me know me ahead of time and quietly step out of class to take the call.

#### Communicate
If you have any questions, would like extra help, or need further instruction,
please reach out to me. You can communicate with me via email, sign up for
office hours, speak with me before class, after class or during breaks.
Please let me know if you have any concerns about the material or your
progress in the course. I am very willing to help, but you have to take the
first step of reaching out to me.

### Academic Integrity
As set forth in NYU Abu Dhabi's Academic Integrity Policy, the relationship
between students and faculty at NYU Abu Dhabi is defined by a shared
commitment to academic excellence and is grounded in an expectation of
fairness, honesty, and respect, which are essential to maintaining the
integrity of the community. Every student who enrolls and everyone who accepts
an appointment as a member of the faculty or staff at NYU Abu Dhabi agrees to
abide by the expectation of academic honesty.  The full policies and
procedures relating to Academic Integrity may be found on the [NYUAD Student
Portal](https://students.nyuad.nyu.edu/campus-life/student-policies/community-standards-policies/academic-integrity/)

### Teaching Methodology
This is a production-based course that involves programming, electronics, and
mechanisms work both inside and outside of the classroom.  Examples will
presented and discussed throughout, and students will be required to write
code, build circuits, build mechanisms, ask questions, and engage in both
creative and technical discussion. The course embraces a process-oriented
philosophy believing that programming, electronics, and mechatronics
development are best learned by doing. 

### Course Mission: L.E.G.S.
* Learn - skills, tools, processes, techniques, resources
* Explore - challenges, risks, failures, adventures, dreams 
* Grow - advance, empower, progress, reflect, repeat
* Share - describe, document, communicate, contribute, participate

### Homework Assignments
There will be homework assignments in each class. Homework may include
reading, watching videos, doing exercises, constructing circuits and
mechanisms, and completing projects. Students may collaborate with classmates
and work together on any assignment(s), but everyone must share/submit their
own individual work.  

Some class time will be spent going over assignments. Expect to be asked to
show your work every class. Some classes everyone may demonstrate their work,
other classes only a few students will share, but always be prepared to do so.
All of your work must be completed on time prior to class.

### Online Journal
Students must document all their work in a Github repository. This must
include:

* a well organized repository with helpful file and folder names
* description of each assignment or project
* discuss what you chose to do and why
* document any resources/research/inspiration
* all code, well structured and commented
* schematics
* drawings of mechanisms
* highlight both successes and failures

The purpose of the journal is threefold. First, it is a valuable way for you to communicate that you are keeping up with the work in the class and that you are grasping the material. I read the journals to see how you are doing. 

Second, the journal is a way to document your work for your own use. You must
update the journal each week with the work you have done for class. You should
use the journal as an opportunity to write clearly write your thoughts,
questions, and analysis based on the class assignments. The writing is
expected to be well reasoned and grammatically correct. You should link to any
relevant sources, and provide context, such as images, video or audio, when
appropriate. 

Third, we all make extensive use of online resources generously created by
others. By sharing our own work, we pay forward, making what we learned
available in the hopes that others might benefit.

### Project 1: A system with at least 3 sensors and 3 actuators
Date assigned: Class 6  
Date due: Class 10

**Purpose**
Having learned the basics of electronics, Arduino, sensors and
actuators, and programming, this project is an exercise in the understanding
and application of the technical material we have covered. 

**Assignment**
Design and construct a simple interactive system with at least 3
sensors and 3 actuators. The system must contain some sort of state
information so that its behavior depends on its inputs (sensor readings) as
well as its previous state. The system must react promptly to changes at its
sensors, i.e. the Arduino delay() function must not be used.

Additional information: There is no need to address any artistic topic in this
project.

### Project 2: Interactive Performative Machine (Autonomous or Remote Controlled)
Date assigned: Class 10  
Date due: Class 14

**Purpose**
In a performance, an actor must respond to cues from other actors.
Similarly, unless entirely controlled by a master sequencer, a robotic
performer must wait for an appropriate "trigger" before performing its
action. In this project students will develop machines that can "perform" a
small number of pre-programmed sequences on "cues"

**Assignment**
Design and construct a simple interactive device that can be used
for performance. Your machine must have at least 3 "sequences" or "activities"
that it will perform on demand. These sequences can be triggered either by
remote control or by some interaction with another "performer". You may use 
some or all of the circuit and/or the mechanism you built for Project 1.

### Project 3: Prototype of Final Project
Date Assigned: Class 14  
Date Due: Class 20

**Purpose**
The final project will be a "robot" that is capable
of participating, or "performing", in a "performance"
that the class will create.   
(Keep in mind that the terms "robot" and "performance" are broadly defined 
and that creative interpretation, implementation, and expression are permitted
and encouraged.)  
One purpose of this project is to build a rough prototype, or
proof-of-concept, of the robot that will be used in the performance, so that
the performance can be rehearsed and so that problems can be identified
while there is still plenty of time to redesign the robot, before the final
project is started.   
In the performance, robots will have to perform on cue,
i.e. when some event occurs that signals that it is now time for their piece.
A second purpose of this project is also to develop and test that capability 
while practising portions of the performance with the other robots.

**Assignment**
Design, build, and debug a rough prototype, or
proof-of-concept, of the robot that will be used in the performance, so that
the performance can be rehearsed and so that problems can be identified
while there is still plenty of time to redesign the robot, before the final
project is started.   
The robot must be capable of performing one or two of the sequences that will 
be needed for the performance, so the class will be coming up with a rough
version of the performance and deciding, as a group, which robot will play
what roles. In the final project, each robot builder will be responsible 
for a robot that is 
capable of all the actions required by that role.    
The robot must be capable of performing these one or two 
actions when it receives the
relevant cue, and then in turn issuing cues to the robot responsible for the
next action.   

### Final Project
Date Assigned: Class 20  
Date due: 
The project will be due in class in week 14. Students will then stage a
live performance at 
the End of Semester Showcase 
that will happen at the end of week 14.

**Purpose**
Learning from Project 3 and taking into account the lessons learned and 
feedback received, students will design, build, and debug a robot to play a
role in the final performance

**Assignment**
Inspired by earlier projects and semester readings and discussions,
Design, build, and debug a polished robot that will be used in the 
final performance. The robot must be capable of performing on cue, and issuing 
cues to other robot performers.  
Your robot will then be required to perform its task in front of a 
live audience during 
the End of Semester Showcase.

#### Class 09 Thursday September 28 9-11:40 AM

* Anyone who did not demonstrate their robot on Tuesday will do so today

* You're going to work with another class 
	(Pierre's Software Art: Image and Software Art: Text) classes
	to stage a performance at the end of semester show 
	(and at the [Echo Festival](http://echodubai.com/)
	in Dubai- stay tuned for details of this festival)
	* The performance will consist of 
		* images projected onto a stage (Software Art: Image)
		* text to be "spoken" by actors (Software Art: Text) 
		* actors (Performing Robots)
	* You will each be paired with someone from the other class 
		(7 pairs and one team of 3)
	* Each team will produce a 3-5 minute vignette
	* The stage will be a simple static stage, flat surface 
		backed by a rear projection screen
	* There will be a sound system so that your robots can "speak"
	* Sound might be an offstage computer and sound system, or a sound
		system on each robot

* How will we do this
	* On Thursdays, Pierre's class meets from 11:50 - 13:05
	*	Next week and the week after, Pierre's class will meet 
		early so they can overlap with us from 10:25-11:40
		* On Thursday October 5 we will visit Software Art to see
			what images they have created and to start a dialog. Use
			this opportunity to see what visuals and personalities
			resonate with you.
		* On Thursday October 12 Software Art will visit us to
			see our first prototypes of our actors. Continue 
			evaluating potential good fits for collaboration.
		* Between now and October 19 you are encourage to meet the
			other students to explore your ideas and interests. 
			This will be a highly collaborative event and the more
			you talk the better it will be
		* On Thursday October 19 each student in both classes will
			provide to their teacher
			the names of two students from the other class
			that they would want to work with. 

* What will we do for the next 2 weeks
	* Make a prototype of an actor. 
		* Rapid, low-fidelity techniques are the only way to accomplish
			this rather ambitious goal in 2 weeks. On the other had, you 
			must use reliable, robust construction techniques: good soldering,
			good wiring management, fault tolerant programs, etc.

* Discussion to start today and to continue throughout:
	* Before designing the "actor" 
		ask yourselves to what kind of WORLD does
	  the actor/robot belong? Is it a real/fictionalal/human/machine world?
		(Maybe this develops in parallel with the actor.)
	* What is an actor? 
	* Do actors have to be mobile? Can a stationary device be an actor? Does
		it have to have movement at all? It certainly can, we now have plenty
		of motors, but are there other ways to act?
	* Does an actor have to be modelled after life forms as we know them?
	* How might (optional) sensors be used in your actor?
	* Do you want your actor to be fully autonomous, fully remote controlled,
		or some hybrid?
	* Do you want to emulate a human actor in some way?
	* Do you want your robot to be able to express itself in ways humans 
		can not? 
		To think of it another way, 
		if you could give your actor super powers, what would they be?

* Overall philosophy:
	* Discuss, sketch, prototype, evaluate, repeat

* Farfalle update
	* You can visit the Farfalle 
		"virtual playground" 
		installation on Tuesday, October 3rd 
		between 4-8pm
	* If you want to attend any of the performances, send 
		[Linsey Bostwick](linsey.bostwick@nyu.edu)
		your name and the date/time you want to go
	* Workshop takes place 7-10 pm Wednesday October 4 
		in the Black Box theater.
		Friends and family welcome.
* Homework assignment due Tuesday October 3

	I've struggled to find the right words to convey the goal of this
	assignment: I want you to start giving shape to your ideas so that we
	can discuss in class on Tuesday, and so that you can start making 
	something that you can show to the Software Art students on October 12.

	The goal here is to generate ideas and to convey a style or direction, 
	and emphatically not to imagine the actor you will build for the
	final project.

	If you have other ways to show ideas and to express yourselves
	send me email and most likely I'll allow that instead of the assignment 
	below.

	* Create
		**three** "sketches" that somehow convey the kind of actor 
		that interests you
		or the kind of world that you want your actor to inhabit.
		These sketches might take a variety of forms, including, but 
		not limited to:
		* drawings (on paper, screen, napkins, whatever)
		* wire figures
		* [paper cut
		out](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/30/85/2e/30852e06a64adf69c31a5f66b62b3142.jpg)
		* Pictures from internet or magazines
		* photographs
		* [food
		  sculpture](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6a/5a/1d/6a5a1d1d4c94464737ee884330e4c32d.jpg)  
	whatever conveys your ideas. As always,
		bring to class and put on your Github repository.
	* Start creating **one** low-fidelity prototype. Cardboard and masking tape
	  is fine. It does not need to be
		finished yet, nor does it have to be fully functional yet, but you should
		have a pretty good idea of what sensors and actuators you want to use 
		and where they and the rest of the electronics and batteries will go.  
		The purpose of this exercise is to 
		build something by October 12 that will convey to 
		students in Software Art something about the direction you might take.  
		This will not necessarily be the actor you create for the final project.  
		This project **must** must be functional by October 12 
		(more on this later).  
		As always, bring this to class so we can discuss.
	* Visit the Cube gallery and view the images generated by 
		the Software Art: Image class


#### Class 10 Tuesday October 3 9-10:15 AM

* Discussion:
	* Remove laptops, phones, and other distractions. 
		Put your 3 sketches 
		and the start of your low-fidelity prototype 
		on the table.
		Share and discuss. How will you move forward from here?
	* What do you need?
	 	You will need to create realistic plans
		and make sure that you are on schedule
		in order to finish a prototype of your actor
		by Thursday October 12. What can you learn from your experience 
		with the robot project? What allowed some people to have 
		projects ready early, while others were not complete by the deadline?
		We must all look honestly at what happens and learn from our experiences.
		What will you do
		if things take longer than you anticipate, if things break,
		if things don't work the way you expect? 
		I make multiple backup plans,
		try to identify areas of greatest risk and solve those first,
		and try to make sure that I have much more time than necessary
		to finish my Minimal Viable Project if all else fails. (Part of
		the backup plan.)
	* Is there any new material you need me to cover for your actors?
* Review: What is the difference between the 5 servo motors in your kits?

* Homework assignment due Thursday October 5
	* Choose one concept to develop further. Most of you had 
	  pretty solid ideas. Some of you had concepts that were still quite
		far from solid ideas. I want you all to make progress 
		you have something ready to show the other students.
		Many of you might need appointments with me to help move
		your concept to something concrete. It is your responsibility 
		to reach out to me if this is the case.

#### Class 11 Thursday October 5

	* Short motor overview
	* Quick debugging review
	* Work session with individual help as needed
	* 10:25 Visit from Pierre's Software Art: Image class to show 
		us what they have

* Homework assignment due Tuesday October 10

	* This assignment does not need to be your final project.
		This project is an exploration, a sketch, and a practice exercise.
		There are two primary goals here:

		1. Convey your creativity to your potential partner(s) for the
			final project
		2. A chance to try something different from our first robot
			project and to learn from this experience. You might be learning
			about a new (to you) technology or you might be learning some
			new mechanical or construction technique

	* This assignment does not need to work perfectly but does need to
		work well enough to:

		1. Convey your creativity

		2. Convince me that all risky technical issues have been addressed,
			if not implemented

	* Your project should be mostly done on Tuesday so that it can 
		be finished by Thursday

#### Tuesday October 10 9-10:15 AM

* Assignment status report
* Problem solving advice

#### Thursday October 12 9-11:40 AM

* Discussion: Knowing what you know now, what do you think a robotic performance
	might look like?
* 10:25 Visit from Pierre's Software Art: Image class:
	We show them what we have

* Homework assignment due Tuesday October 17
	* Download and install [Fritzing](fritzing.org)
	* Read or watch resources 2-3 of the [Fritzing 
	  Resources](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#fritzing-resources)
	* Experiment with Fritzing. Try to create your own simple schematic. You can
	 start from scratch, 
	 start with an example you find online, 
	 or start with one of my
	 [examples](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/Fritzing). Your schematic
	 doesn't need to be correct, I just want you to have some experience with
	 the program.
	* Partner Preferences for collaboration between Software Art and Performing
	  Robots

		* Please indicate whether you would like to be on a team with two people 
			(one from each class) or three people (one from Software Art and two 
				from Performing Robots).
