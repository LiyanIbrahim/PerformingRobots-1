###Course Description

In this course we will learn about and build Experimental Robots for
Theatrical Performance. Consisting of both theory and practice studnets will
learn about electronics, programming, robotics, and mechanical construction
techniques, as well as the use of machines in theatrical performances, both
historical and contemporary. We define robots very broadly, and consider a
broad range of machines both autonomous and remote-controlled. 

Consisting of lecture, discussion, and hands-on construction, students will go
through some electro-mechanical construction exercises before moving on to the
major project of the course: building a robot. The course will culminate with
a performance.

TODO: flesh out the big ideas/questions that the class is addressing. Is it
"How do you design an automated performance" or "How do we assign emotional
characteristics to robots" or "How do behaviors convey meaning" or
something(s) else?

TODO:  add a bit more language in both the "Course Description" section and
the "Learning Objectives" list that speaks to the "big picture questions" that
the course will address. The UCC is constantly asking us to keep the "liberal
arts" in mind when we develop our courses, which, in their words, means - "why
do we care about this" and "what does this have to do with the human
condition".  They are fine with our classes being heavily project-based, but
it really helps if we can clearly articulate why making these types of
projects are relevant and meaningful.  This was one of the big notes we
received when we first proposed IM to become a major in that our program read
as being a bit too applied and that we needed to do a better job explaining
the importance of learning through making. So, for example, adding language
like "...from automated cars to home service assistants...intelligent
robots/machines are steadily becoming our daily companions... How can we can
make sense of these human-like machines...how can we manage our dependence on
them...how can we leverage art and design to influence and steer the robots of
our future..." or something ...  Depending on the questions we want to
investigate.

###Course Objectives: (TODO)
When the course is finished, students will:
- Identify 
- Have gained an understanding of how machines can be interactive and 
	autonomous
- Be able to design and develop
- Identify 
- Develop a basic understanding of electronics, programming, and mechatronics
- Develop a basic understanding of the principles of simple robotics
- Learn about the history and contemporary state of robots and other machines
	in theatrical performance
- Learn how to define and build a Minimum Viable Project, and how to adapt
	dependencies (e.g. scripts) to changing abilities

###Course Assignments
This course consists of theoretical readings and discussions,
technical training in electronics, programming, and mechatronics,
designing, fabricating, and programming a performing robot,
and putting on a final performance.

####Readings
Readings will include selections from books, essays, articles, and research
papers both in print and in online form. The readings will introduce students
to the history, current state, and critique of autonomous interactive
robotic art, as well as covering technical topics.

####Reading Response 
Each student is expected to post a response to one of the readings of their
choosing the day before the lecture. The response should be between 300 and
500 words and should be posted on a public website (e.g. Tumblr, Blogger, 
Wordpress, Github, the class website, or your own website). 


####Projects
Class projects will consist of 2 short projects leading up to a major third
project

All required and recommended readings will be available electronically.

Supplemental readings will be available on the class GitHub or in the library.

####Required Textbooks
There are no required textbooks.

####Recommended Textbooks
There are no recommended textbooks.

####Supplemental Textbooks
See section titled "Books" [here](references.md)

###Attendance and Participation

####Attendance and late arrivals
Attendance and arrival on time to all class sessions is required and
expected. Two unexcused absences lower your final grade by a letter.  Each
subsequent unexcused absence will lower another letter grade. Two late
arrivals will count as one absence. Arriving more than 20 minutes late will
also count as an absence.

If you will be missing a class due to illness or unavoidable personal
circumstances, you must notify your professor in advance via email for the
absence to be eligible to be excused.

####Participation
Showing up on time, engaging in the class discussion, and offering advice and
input during class is a major part of your grade. Participating in class is
helpful for me to get to know you as an individual and keep track of your
progress, but most importantly, it provides you and your classmates the
opportunity to share successes, failures, and insights into the work you are
doing.

Turn in all assignments on time. For each day an assignment is late, it will
result in a lower final grade (e.g. B+ to B).

You are expected to show work in class. This includes your Github repository,
your attempts, and your results whether working or not. You will share what
worked and what didn't.  Basically, don’t be afraid to volunteer to show what
you did do or failed to do. Explaining your work to other people is a great
way to better understand the material and answer questions for yourself. Plus,
showing work that did not function as expected is not a sign of failure, it is
an opportunity to learn. 

Ask questions. If you do not ask questions, I can only assume that you are not
prepared for the lesson.

####Laptops
Laptop use will be expected in class, but should be focused on class-specific
material, applications, and research. Whenever classmates are presenting
please keep your laptop closed. The quality of the class depends in large part
on your engagement and active participation, so please respect your fellow
classmates and close your lid.

####Mobile Phones
 Please put them on vibrate or turn them off before you come to class. If you
have an emergency that requires you to answer your phone during class, please
let me know me ahead of time or quietly step out of class to take the call.

####Communicate
If you have any questions, would like extra help, or need further instruction,
please reach out to me. You can communicate with me via e-mail, sign up for
ofice hours, speak with me before class, after class or during break, but
please let me know if you have any concerns pertaining to the course. I am
very willing to help, but you have to take the first step of reaching out to
me.

Teaching Methodology
--------------------
This is a production-based course that involves programming, working with
electronics, and working with mechanisms work both inside and outside of the
classroom.  reviewed. Examples will presented and discussed throughout, and
students will be required to write code, build circuits, build mechanisms, ask
questions, and engage in both creative and technical discussion. The course
embraces a process-oriented philosophy believing that programming,
electronics, and mechatronics development are best learned by doing. 

Course Mission: L.E.G.S.
------------------------
* Learn - skills, tools, processes, techniques, resources
* Explore - challenges, risks, failures, adventures, dreams 
* Grow - advance, empower, progress, reflect, repeat
* Share - describe, document, communicate, contribute, participate

Homework Assignments
---------------
There will be homework assignments in each class. Homework may include
reading, watching videos, doing exercises, constructing circuits and
mechanisms, and completing projects. Students may collaborate with classmates
and work together on any assignment(s), but everyone must share/submit their
own individual work.  

Some class time will be spent going over assignments. Expect to be asked to
show your work every class. Some classes everyone may demonstrate their work,
other classes only a few students will share, but always be prepared to do so.
All of your work must be completed on time prior to class.

Online Journal
---------------
Students must document all their work in a Github repository. This must
include:

* a well organized repository with helpful file and folder names
* description of each assignment or project
* discuss what you chose to do and why
* document any resources/research/inspiration
* all code, well structured and commented
* schematics
* drawings of mechanisms
* highlight both successes and failures

The purpose of the journal is threefold. First, it is a valuable way for you to communicate that you are keeping up with the work in the class and that you are grasping the material. I read the journals to see how you are doing. 

Second, the journal is a way to document your work for your own use. You must
update the journal each week with the work you have done for class. You should
use the journal as an opportunity to write clearly write your thoughts,
questions, and analysis based on the class assignments. The writing is
expected to be well reasoned and grammatically correct. You should link to any
relevant sources, and provide context, such as images, video or audio, when
appropriate. 

Third, we all make extensive use of online resources generously created by
others. By sharing our own work, we pay forward, making what we learned
available in the hopes that others might benefit.
