  The catalog of a show at the UC Berkeley art museum from that year.
  I found some copies on sale at the museum a couple years ago.
  It is fascinating, both for what was being done and shown here --
  dating from the early 20th century to the 60's -- and for wondering
  why it was not being done and shown in the late 20th century...

  social systems in 1970.

## Notes

1. A robotic performance differs from a robotic installation in that a
performance has a beginning and end, and a script

## Questions

1. What is "Automata" vs. "Autonomous beings"?

1. What is interactive?

Essays like Heinrich von Kleist’s “On the Marionette Theater” and Edward Gordon Craig’s “The Actor and the Über-marionette” have suggested that [End Page 400] skillful automata might productively replace and surpass the human actor.
