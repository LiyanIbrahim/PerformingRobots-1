- If you are new to functions or want to review, 
watch Dan 
Shiffman's [functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCu7JSkgl04&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ajGB2OI3hl5DZsD1Fw1WzR) tutorials. There are four videos, each less than 10 minutes.

Production Assignment:

- Prepare a space for working with electronics
	- Have some space to work. There are many small components in the kit that
	will be easily lost, so ideally be seated at a table or desk with clear
	space around you.
	- The kit will include a hot glue gun. You will need a safe place with an
		electric outlet to work. To protect your work surface from drops of hot
		glue, cover it with cardboard or paper. You will need to keep the hot glue
		gun out of the reach of children or animals.
	- You will be building a robot. In order to give each robot its unique
		personality, start collecting cardboard boxes for constructing the robot,
		and varied items that can be glued to your robot. Wooden items such as
		coffee stirrers or popsickle sticks, plastic items like bottle caps, and
		cardboard such as toilet paper tubes are excellent candidates. If you have
		younger siblings consider things like pieces of broken toys and game
		tokens. Look for interesting scraps in your recycling bin and when you
		walk outside.
- Install the Arduino IDE from
	[here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). If you are on Windows chose
	the Windows Installer.
