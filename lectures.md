Introduction

- What is a robot?
- What is performance?
- Watch some videos
	- [Welcome to Duloc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X81AoBcVnaA)
	- [Survival Research Labs](https://youtu.be/aZwkvM4BzN4?t=302)
	- [Bot and Dolly](https://youtu.be/lX6JcybgDFo?t=132)
	- [Oriza Hirata](https://youtu.be/CWnnqObk1qM)

- What this class is about [Course Outline](schedule.md)
- Who am I?
- Syllabus
- Summary:
  -  Be present and participate in class
  -  No electronic distractions
  -  Be proactive: Communicate with me regarding difficulties, problems, illness, etc.
  -  Allow lots of time for homework as physical construction
  and debugging circuits and programs can be very time consuming.
- Announcements
  - Become a lab assistant!  Contact Ume (uh242@nyu.edu)
  - IM Lab Open House September 4 evening (with giant pizza!)
- Who are you?

Lecture
- 
- [Basic
	mechanisms](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#mechatronic-resources)  
- Construction Techniques  
- Exercise   

**Assignment due August 29**
1. I strongly encourage that you make substantial progress on your cardboard
	 mechanism so that you can ask questions, and so that you can next work
	 on motorizing your project
1. Bring your laptop to class 
1. Read the syllabus

**Assignment due September 5**  

Build a cardboard device demonstrating at least two different basic mechanism.
Your device must be motorized and must run for 30 seconds without breaking

#### Thursday August 29 1:15 - 2:30

**Announcements**

- Clean up after yourselves! Includes but not limited to: 
	- Drill bits back in holder
	- Vacuum
	- Unplug hot glue guns
	- Put away my project if you move it
- Be a lab monitor! Job description and instructions for applying are
	[here](https://app.joinhandshake.com/jobs/3024058)  
- IM Lab Open House September 4 evening (with giant pizza!)  
- Please note the
[grading](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/PerformingRobots/blob/master/syllabus.md#grading) rubric in the syllabus  

**Motors!**

- Hand out motors, wheels, Arduino, USB cable
- Connect motors to Arduino, see how they turn
	- Reverse

Construction

- How to attach motors to project

1. Install Arduino from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
	 Scroll down a little bit to the "Arduino IDE"". If you're on Windows, you
	 want the first item, the Windows Installer. 

1. Read the first three Arduino resources
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#basic-arduino-resources-from-arduino)

#### Tuesday September 3 1:15 - 3:55

**Arduino!**

- Verify installed properly (test with blink)
- Understand blink 
- Hand out wires, breadboard, LEDs, LDR, resistors
- Add an LED
- Add another LED  
- Digital inputs
- Analog output

Time permitting

- Analog input
- Digital output

#### Thursday September 5 1:15 - 2:30

**Show your fantastic machines!**

**Review**

- Arduino, breadboards, circuits, components, schematics
- Programming: analog/digital I/O 
- Loops
- Conditionals

**Lecture**

- DC motors
- Transistors

### current-homework-assignment

**Assignment due September 10**

1. Read the first five motor resources [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#motors-resources). 
	You don't need to know this in depth, 
	just enough
	to know how the different types of motors behave.
1. Read the second transistor resource
	 [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#transistor-resources).
	 Again, you don't need to know this in depth, just become familiar with the
	 concept of using a transistor as a switch.
1. Learn about the Adafruit motor shield by reading the sixth resource
	 [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#motors-resources).
	 This will be important and we will review in class, but you will understand
	 it better if you try to understand the tutorial.
1. Create a github account (if you don't have one) and a repository for this
	 class by following the first resource
	 [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#github-resources). Remember to name the
	 repository "performingRobots".

#### Tuesday September 10 1:15 - 3:55

We don't need computers for the first part of our lesson

**Homework**

- Who did the reading?
- Who made a github account and repository? Any problems? Any questions?
- I forgot to ask you to email me the URL to your repository. (Don't do this
	now).

**Review**

- Transistors to control high current loads (not only motors)
- How to reverse a motor
- Different types of motors
	- DC motors
	- Servo motors
		- DC motor + gears + position sensor + feedback circuit (servo loop)
	- Stepper motors
		- A whole lot of electromagnets arranged in a circle around a permanent
			magnet rotor

**Demo**
Soldering!
	- wires to each other
	- wires to scrap boards
	- pins to scrap boards
Pins!
	- Male
	- Female
	- Feed-through

**Activity** (time permitting)
Motor shields!

**Assignment due September 12**

- Read for discussion *******************
- Practice soldering
	- wires to each other
	- wires to scrap boards
	- pins to scrap boards
- When you are ready and comfortable
	- Solder **feed-through** headers to your motor shield
