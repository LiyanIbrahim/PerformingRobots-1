	- Reverse

Construction

- How to attach motors to project

1. Install Arduino from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
	 Scroll down a little bit to the "Arduino IDE"". If you're on Windows, you
	 want the first item, the Windows Installer. 

1. Read the first three Arduino resources
[here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#basic-arduino-resources-from-arduino)

#### Tuesday September 3 1:15 - 3:55

**Lecture**

- DC motors
- Transistors

**Assignment due September 10**

1. Read the first five motor resources [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#motors-resources). 
	You don't need to know this in depth, 
	just enough
	to know how the different types of motors behave.
1. Read the second transistor resource
	 [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#transistor-resources).
	 Again, you don't need to know this in depth, just become familiar with the
	 concept of using a transistor as a switch.
1. Learn about the Adafruit motor shield by reading the sixth resource
	 [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#motors-resources).
	 This will be important and we will review in class, but you will understand
	 it better if you try to understand the tutorial.
1. Create a github account (if you don't have one) and a repository for this
	 class by following the first resource
	 [here](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses#github-resources). Remember to name the
	 repository "performingRobots".

**Assignment due Tuesday October 8**

You all have a lot to do. Please don't wait until Monday evening to start.
Most of you are new to this kind of work, and most likely the plan you have in
your head will not work. The big problem is that the model in your head is
unlikely to be how the physical reality really works, and you have to allow
time to build it once, see what doesn't work, make a change which might not
fix everything and in fact might introduce new problems, make another change,
etc. Anyone experienced will tell you that you this is an iterative process,
and it takes time. The only way to learn is by doing it.

If you run into problems, email me. I am more available this weekend than on
Sunday and Monday.

Max: Get the base tracking a line. Talk to me about batteries. Attach the
Arduino and breadboard to the base in a safe way that doesn't interfere with
the rest of the robot. You may make an enclosure but that's not necessary. I
prefer open enclosures for easy access.

Praggya: Make the face and the arms. I suggest you use a different Arduino
from Max's that will operate the base. You may also need separate batteries
for the servos. Make time to talk to me before Tuesday.  Attach the Arduino
and breadboard to the base in a safe way that doesn't interfere with the rest
of the robot. You may make an enclosure but that's not necessary. I prefer
open enclosures for easy access. Also get the Neopixel face working.

Paulin: Detect hands, send values to Arduino. Test with Praggya's hands to
actually make them move. Figure out where the Kinect will mount and how it
will get power. You might need to talk to me about batteries as well.

Maria: Get the arms controlled. Your team needs a body of some kind to which
everything will attach (I see you discussed arms, head, and base, but no
body). Attach the Arduino and breadboard to the body in a safe way that
doesn't interfere with the rest of the robot. You may make an enclosure but
that's not necessary. I prefer open enclosures for easy access. You can make
the body an open box (like I did) and use that as your enclosure for the
Arduino. You can use multiple boxes like I did to make separate places for the
Arduino and batteries. It will also make it a bit stronger.

Gabi: Legs, and see the comments to Maria

Michael: Base. I thought about this last night and I think the lazy susan
might not be the best thing. Email me and arrange a time to meet before
Tuesday. You must build this and get it running by Tuesday. That means build
it this weekend because it will not work the first time, I can almost
guarantee. Leave yourself time to rebuild it at least once or twice.

Ahmed: Legs. Get them working. Your team needs a body of some kind to which
everything will attach. Attach the Arduino and breadboard to the body in a
safe way that doesn't interfere with the rest of the robot. You may make an
enclosure but that's not necessary. I prefer open enclosures for easy access.
You can make the body an open box (like I did) and use that as your enclosure
for the Arduino. You can use multiple boxes like I did to make separate places
for the Arduino and batteries. It will also make it a bit stronger.

Pangna: Lifting mechanism. Get it working. As you know from prior fabrication
classes, this is not easy. You should plan to build it this weekend because it
will probably not work the first time, as you know. Leave yourself time to
rebuild it at least once or twice. I have some ideas for you as well and I'm
happy to meet this weekend to discuss.

Hatim: Read all the comments above, as many apply to you. In addition you have
the lights to get working. Talk to Praggya about Neopixels.

Robots are due. Grading rubric:

- Functionality: 50%
The robot must function as described below
- Construction: 35%
Your robot must be robust and well constructed. 
- Creative appearance 15%
Appearance should evidence experimentation and creativity, but final result is
not so important, by which I mean I don't really care how it looks as long as
you've experimented
