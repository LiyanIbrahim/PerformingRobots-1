### September 9

Administration

- Record lesson
- Discuss homework

Do along with me

- [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com) 
- Circuit
- Code
- ````if()```` statement (conditionals)
- ````for()```` loop
- Comparisons
	- Arduino reference page
	- Complex comparisons
- Communication
	- ````Serial()````
- Variables
- Functions
	- let's move the blinking into a separate function
	- Why use functions?
-	Making your program easier to read
	- For yourself and for others (e.g. your professor)
	- Good names for variables and functions
	- Functions
	- Indentation
	- Comments

Here is the example I did in class. I had made an error in both the code and
the circuit. See if you can spot the differences. First is what you saw
in class, with errors:

![circuitWithError](inClassExamples/september9/sept9CircuitWithError.png)
[Code](inClassExamples/september9/sept9CodeWithError.ino) with error

Now with corrections. Note where I used ````Serial.println()```` 
to help me find the problem:

[Code](inClassExamples/september9/sept9CodeCorrected.ino) after corrections


### September 14

Administration

- Welcome to week 2!
- Record lesson
- Questions about the homework

Test Arduino 
- Install [CH340
	driver](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers)
- IDE
- blink

What else can we do?
- Serial
- IO foursome

Review
- Varibles
	- int, float
	- Difference between 
		- Declaration, which creates, or allocates, the variable
		- Assignment, which gives it a value
- Varible scope
	- Local
		- Allocation and freeing
	- Global
		- Allocated and never freed
- Functions

Reminder:
- Good variable and function names
- Indentation (demonstrate CTRL-T)

In-class exercise:
- Write a function that blinks an LED 5 times
	- Call it from setup
	- Call it from loop
	- How would you make it happen only once from loop?
		- State variable

Functions with arguments
- One argument
- Multiple arguments
- Return value!

Here are the examples we developed in class. First 
a function that takes two arguments and returns nothing:

````
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  sayHello(9.7, 107); // intentionally passed the wrong parameter to show what happens
}

// A function that takes two arguments and returns nothing
void sayHello(int someInt, float someFloat) {
  Serial.print(someInt);
  Serial.print("  ");
  Serial.print(someFloat);
  Serial.println(" hello");
}
````

And now a function that takes one argument and returns something:

````
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

boolean firstTime = true; // state variable remembers whether it's the first time or not

void loop() {
  if (firstTime == true) {
    float theAnswer = blinkTimes(5);
    firstTime = false;
    Serial.println(theAnswer);
  }
}

// A function that takes one argument and returns a float
float blinkTimes(int count) {
  for (int i = count; i > 0; i -= 1) {
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
    delay(500);
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
    delay(500);
  }
  return (count / 3.0);
}
````

#### Do along with me

MP3 Trigger

- Sparkfun
	[documentation](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-mp3-trigger-hookup-guide/all)
- Insert uSD card gently
	- **Caution**: Do not pull on the uSD card! It must be pressed to be released!
- Library: SparkFun MP3 Trigger
- Use USB-C cable to connect drigger
	- It should show up as a thumb drive
	- Copy an MP3 file to the card. You can use [this](media/T001.mp3) or
		[this](media/T002.mp3)
- Example: Example1-PlaySong
- What else can the library do?
	- Look at other examples
	- [Functions](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_MP3_Trigger_Arduino_Library/blob/master/src/SparkFun_Qwiic_MP3_Trigger_Arduino_Library.h)
- Start thinking about what kind of sounds your robot will make. Will it
	speak? What kind of a voice will it use? Will it make non-speech sounds?
	Start collecting sounds that might be useful. You can record your own or
	find them on the internet (be sure to document where you got them) e.g.
	[here](https://archive.org/details/HB01SFX)

Motor Driver

- Sparkfun
	[documentation](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/hookup-guide-for-the-qwiic-motor-driver)
- Connect motors (polarity doesn't matter)
- Connect battery connector 
	- **Caution** polarity is critical!!
	- **Caution** do not plug in the battery until you have checked 3 times
	that the polarity is right!!
	- **Caution** Do not touch the battery to the connector backwards!!
- Library: Serial Controlled Motor Driver
- Example: Copy example from
	[here](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/hookup-guide-for-the-qwiic-motor-driver#experiment-1-testing-the-motors)
	(scroll down a little bit)

Here is the motor dance code:

````
void loop()
{
  // do a little dance and then stop
  //    stop both motors for 5 seconds
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 0); //Stop motor
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 0, 0); //Stop motor
  delay (5000);

  // go forward for 10 seconds
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 200);
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 1, 180);
  delay(10000);

  // turn right just a little
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 50);
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 0, 25);
  delay(500);


  // if you don't want it to stop, remove this:
  while (1)
    ;

}

  if ((motorIsRunning == false) && (currentMillis - motorOffAt > motorOffPerid)) {
    //time to turn motor on
    mp3.playTrack(2); //play this song
    Serial.println("in if");
    myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 70);
    myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 1, 70);
    motorOnAt = currentMillis; //update the timer
    motorIsRunning = true;
  }
  // otherwise, check to see if it's time to turn the motor off
  else if ((motorIsRunning == true) && (currentMillis - motorOnAt > motorOnPeriod)) {
    //time to turn motor off
    stopping();
    motorOffAt = currentMillis; //update the timer
    motorIsRunning = false;
  }

  // checking switch
  // starting at stopping mp3 playback
  // display things on OLED
}
````
